# Goal and outline

# Finding similar items

# Jaccard similarity

# Shingling

# Your turn

shingling and Jaccard similarity by hand

# Useful packages/functions in `R`

# Example data

# Your turn 

shinging and Jaccard similarity with R

# Hashing

Why do it?

# Similarity preserving summaries of sets

# Characteristic matrix

# Minhashing

# LSH (avoid pairwise comparisons)

# Banding and buckets

# Your turn 

banding in R

# Putting it all together

# "Easy" LSH in R

# Evaluation

# Your turn

perform LSH and evaluate how we did
