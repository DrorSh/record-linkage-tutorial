Title: Will the Real Terry Tao Please Stand Up: A Probabilistic Approach to Graphical Entity Resolution*

Information about social entities is often spread across multiple large databases, each degraded by noise, and without unique identifiers shared across databases.  Entity resolution --- reconstructing the actual entities and their attributes --- 
is essential to using big data, and is itself a challenging inference problem. 
In this talk, I describe a novel approach to entity resolution, by discovering a bipartite graph, which links manifest records to a common set of latent entities. This representation leads to a hierarchical Bayesian model which simultaneously infers the linkage graph, the attributes and number of latent entities, and the parameters of the distortion process.  Our model quantifies the uncertainty in the inference and propagates this uncertainty into subsequent analyses.  Our model also leads to a linear-time inference algorithm that scales efficiently to multiple, large, multi-dimensional databases. We test our model on the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), a longitudinal study of the health of the elderly individuals, which tracked over 57,000 people in multiple over-lapping waves (http://www.nltcs.aas.duke.edu).  Our algorithm links individuals across waves with high accuracy using only a few noisy variables from each record.
