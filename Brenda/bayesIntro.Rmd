# Why Bayes?

A Bayesian framework is suitable to solve the following
problems:

\vspace{1mm}

- Exact computation of the probability that each pair is a match,
conditional on the observed data. 
    * Results conditioning on observed events are more directly interpretable than those obtained by conditioning on unobservable hypotheses.

\vspace{2mm}

- Propagating linkage error as an added component of uncertainty in the estimation process.
    * Relevant for subsequent modeling.

# Clustering Approaches

- Record linkage can be naturally seen as a clustering problem.
    * Supervised and unsupervised approches.
    
\vspace{2mm}

- Records representing the same individual are clustered to a latent entity producing a partition of the data.

# Record Linkage and Clustering 

Which records correspond to the same person?

# Record Linkage and Clustering 

Each entity is associated with one or more records and the
goal is to recover the latent entities (clusters).

# Graphical Record Linkage

Graphical model representation of  \textcolor{blue}{Steorts et al. (2016)}:
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
- $\Lambda_{ij}$ represents the linkage structure $\rightarrow$  \textcolor{blue}{uniform prior}.
<!--uniform over the set of {1,...,N}
such that each record is assumed to be equally likely a priori to correspond to any of the N latent individuals. Thus, it treats the records as if they are a random sample drawn with replacement.
% any two partitions with the same number of latent entities are equally probably a priori.--> 
- Requires information about the number of latent entities a priori and it is very informative.

# Partition-based Bayesian clustering models

Goal: cluster N data points $x_1,\cdots, x_N$ into $K$ clusters.

\vspace{1mm}

- Place a prior distribution over partitions of $[N] = \{1,\ldots,N\}$

\vspace{1mm}

- Let $C_N$ be a random partition of $[N]$

\vspace{1mm}

- $C_N$ represented by a set of cluster assignments $z_1,\ldots ,z_N$.

\vspace{1mm}

- The number of clusters $K$ does not need to be specified a priori $\rightarrow$
\textcolor{blue}{Non-parametric} latent variable approach.

\vspace{1cm}

- The number of data points in each cluster should remain small even for large data sets $\rightarrow$ Large number of singletons and small clusters.
\end{minipage}

# Mixture Models

Other clustering tasks require models that assume cluster sizes
grow linearly with the size of the data set.

Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP)

<!--The Ministry of Social Development in Mexico is in charge of creating and assigning social programmes targeting specific needs in the population for the improvement of quality of life. To better target the social programmes, the Ministry is aimed to find clusters of households with the same needs based on demographic characteristics as well as poverty conditions of the household.-->

# blink

Describe in deatil the blink model, likelihood , prior and hyperparameters
<!-- Smered only handles categorical same as microclustering and Maurcio's paper is for two files and handles strings too?
 
 blink handles both sting and categorical, see comparison with smered in eblink paper-->
